                SCI controls are permitted on SECRET information, but is not 
                permitted on SIPRNet, because it is not an SCI accreditated 
                system.  Therefore, we'll see the SCI container on the JWICS
                policy file indicate that SECRET is an accepable classification
                control, but on the SIPRNet policy, we will not see the same 
                thing, so that SCI classified data is not brought down to 
                SIPRNet.
